# Summary
This is a summary of the work I have completed for the Donaldson Lab.

## [UI Lab Capture](https://github.com/donaldsonlab/UI-lab-capture)
The goal was to create a simple GUI to interface with scientific instruments. The equipment being used included two Blackfly S cameras and a labjack U3-LV. The **UI Lab Capture** solves the problem of making mistakes while initializing different equipment for an experiment. I used multi-threading to help to organize the scheduling of tasks and multi-processing to relieve the stress caused by computatonally intensive tasks.The result was no missed frames which means data can be aligned properly and no post processing is needed to be done. This project taught me alot about outsourcing for help, project deadlines, and how to backtrack once you hit a dead end.
